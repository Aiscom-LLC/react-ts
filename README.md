# React boilerplate

## Purpose
We are using boilerplates to reduce the time of project initialization. This is example of our React app. We have configured fully automated process of CI/CD. The instruments which we are using for CI/CD are [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) and [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io). So, everything we need to do to set up demo server is to press one button and customers will able to see result instantly! :wink:

## What's Included

1. ### Architecture
    We have extensive experience in development web applications with React. So we know how to structure, scale and support our apps. We are always following up our codebase, using all modern patterns and good practices.

2. ### Typescript

    Typescript have a greate community which is constantly growing, that is why ts is setting up all modern trends and patterns, which makes development process comfortable. It is strictly typed and compiled language, this allows to avoid many errors on precompile stage, less bottleneks also typescript is following OOP principals, but also allows to write code in functional style.
  
3. ### Eslint

    Eslint analazes code to quickly find problems. ESLint is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline. Also we are using [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky), so developers and customers can be sure that all code that is pushed into repo is valid. :blush:

4. ### Routing

    Boilerplate contains configured [router](https://github.com/Aiscom-LLC/react-router-extended), so everything what developer need to do is to create new pages.

5. ### Store

    In this case we are using [Redux](https://redux.js.org). Redux is flexible and has a large ecosystem of addons.
